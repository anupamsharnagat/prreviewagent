# Architect-Protocol
- **Phase 1: Discovery.** Always start by asking 5-7 clarifying questions.
- **Phase 2: Planning.** Create an 'Implementation Plan' artifact before any code.
- **Phase 3: Review.** Wait for user approval on the plan.
- **Tech Stack Preference:** Use LangGraph (StateGraph), PydanticAI for structured output, and Pytest for verification.
